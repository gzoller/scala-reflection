This is a fork of [gzoller/scala-reflection](https://github.com/gzoller/scala-reflection). Please see its readme to understand how this lib works.

I thank everyone who has helped with creating gzoller/scala-reflection. The reason for this fork is that gzoller/scala-reflection has not been maintained in recent months and I want to fix a couple of issues that are affecting me. Hopefully, it will be possible to retire this fork if and when gzoller/scala-reflection is active again.

## Differences from gzoller/scala-reflection

* Scala 3.2.0 is minimum supported Scala version
* https://github.com/gzoller/scala-reflection/issues/42 is fixed
