/** Placeholder RType to be lazy-resolved, used for self-referencing types.  This is needed because without it, reflecting on
 *  a self-referencing type will enter an endless loop until the stack explodes.  This RType is immediately inserted into the
 *  type cache so that when the self-reference comes there's something in the cache to find.
 *  When one of these is encountered in the wild, just re-Reflect on the infoClass and you'll get the non-SelfRef (i.e. normal) RType
